Flutter widgets

## Getting Started

This project holds all the flutter widgets examples used in the course Native Apps (of Thomas More, Graduaat Programmeren), given by Marc De Caluwé.
All material in here is made by Marc De Caluwé (partly based on the book Apps ontwikkelen met Flutter by Mark van Heck, used in the course).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
